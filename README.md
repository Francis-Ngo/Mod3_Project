Project Name
Introduction

This is a README file for the "To-Do List App," a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do lists. The app provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as marking them as complete. It also features user authentification. It is built using a combination of modern web technologies and libraries, including React, Vite, React Query, React Router, Mongoose, and Express.
